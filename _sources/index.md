# Welcome to the FCV Slide Analytics Deck

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to generate key figures and insights for the FCV (Fragility, Conflict, and Violence) slide deck. The notebook processes various datasets and produces visualizations related to conflict trends, armed conflict duration, coup attempts, forcibly displaced persons, organized crime, and development indicators.

# Data Sources

The analysis uses multiple datasets, including:

- **ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project)**: Provides real-time data on political violence and protests.
- **UCDP (Uppsala Conflict Data Program)**: Offers detailed conflict data, including battle-related deaths.
- **World Bank Development Indicators**: Covers socioeconomic data such as population projections, education, and sanitation.
- **UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)**: Data on forcibly displaced persons.
- **OECD States of Fragility 2022**: Contains scores and metrics related to various dimensions of fragility, including political, economic, and social factors.
- **UN Population Data**:
- **Poverty, Prosperity and Planet Report 2024**:

## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Raw data is cleaned, filtered, and structured for visualization.
- **Visualization**: Uses Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create figures.
- **Aggregation**: Data is grouped by key dimensions (e.g., region, income group, conflict type) to provide meaningful comparisons.
